# Question 1
There are three different ways that you can declare variables in JavaScript: `var`, `let` and `const`. Code the following to show your understanding: 
- Declare a variable named "on discount" with `let` assigned a value of false.  
- Declare a variable named "fruit" with `var` assigned a value of "apple".
- Declare a variable named "gst" with `const` assigned a value of 0.09.

Then display only the value, with each having their own `console.log()` in the following order:
- on discount
- fruit
- gst

Only display the values in the `console.log()`.

# Question 2
One of the basic concepts of using variables is knowing how to reassign a variable. Using "nameOfFruit" as a variable name, declare and assign it a value of "watermelon". Then create another line of code to reassign the same variable name with the value "rockmelon".

Display only the value using `console.log()`. 

# Question 3
We can use math operators in JavaScript. Declare variables `a` and `b` with values 2 and 9 respectively.

Then create the following:
- declare a sum variable adding `a` and `b`
- declare a multiply variable multiplying `a` and `b` 
- declare a power variable where `a` is to the power of `b` 
- declare a modulus variable where `a` modulo `b`

Display them using console.log() in the following order:
- sum
- multiply
- power
- modulo
